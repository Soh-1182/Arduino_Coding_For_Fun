/* This project is compatible with all microcontrollers in the Arduino series.
   Tools needed are:
1. LED (Most Arduino boards have built-in LED). If you don't want a separate LED, check the board; if it has an LED with an (L) next to it, then you don't need a separate LED.
2. Resistors (220 ohms, or 330 ohms). If you are using built-in LED, skip this.
3. A microcontroller (Arduino).
4. Breadboard
5. 2 male-to-male jumping wires 

Remember to paste this straight into Arduino IDE, connect the Arduino, and hit upload for the project to run on your Arduino.
